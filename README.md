# Jutro sample  app

This is a sample React app that uses Jutro. [Read more on the Jutro documentation site](https://docs.guidewire.com/jutro/documentation/6.5.0/)

# Application Structure

## .jutro

This folder contains all log files.

## i18n

This folder contains auto-generated temporary files that simply hold the UI strings that have been extracted from src/\*\*. Do not manually edit them, or check them into source control. .gitignore is already configured to ignore these files.

## src

This folder contains the application source:

> `app`
> This folder contains App.js files which export the Jutro class that we use as the application entry component. It provides a basic UI application structure with a floorplan to have consistent user experience and UI across Guidewire.

> `assets`
> This folder contains all assets needed for this application.

> `config`
> This folder contains the application configuration file "config.json" to configure this application.

> `i18n`
> This folder contains all generated translation files. Translators will use these files as a basis for further translations.

> `pages`
> This folder contains all the navigation pages used by this application. The presentation metadata for each page is defined in the .metadata.json5 file.

> `styles`
> This folder contains .scss files to support application theme.

## tests

> This folder contains all application test files for e2e and visual tests using TestCafe.

# Useful commands

To install dependencies:

## `npm install`

To run in interactive mode:

## `npm start`

To build a deployment instance.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## `npm run build`

The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
To override this, specify the homepage in your `package.json`.
Add it as a root-level property, for example:

```
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
    // ...
},
    "homepage": "https://example.com/my-app"
}
```
